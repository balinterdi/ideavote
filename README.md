## Ideavote

A very simple, single-page app to submit ideas and cast votes on them. Ideal for user groups.

### Implementation notes

It uses [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) and sits on top of a [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) instance.

You currently need a Github account for authentication so it's mostly for tech groups.
